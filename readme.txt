OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
   character recognition from image is a complex task and require training of datasets to reduce error rate. However there are some pretrained packages that can used for text recognition . This repository uses easyocr and pytorch package to recognise and print text from images,detect their position and print recognised text at top left of text in image itself .

CONTENT
 #A jupyter notebook file that contain for command for installing required packages and code for text recognition. It also have some commands for error that appear while running this codes
 #Few image samples that are tested using this notebook

NOTE
 #This notebook only recognise digital text images precisely and cannot recognise handwriiten text image if its not big and clear.
 #You can edit this notebook to change font size of printed recognised text in the image
